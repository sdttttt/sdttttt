Hi, I am a lazy casual farmers, on the Internet. 
Usually I spend more time reading than coding.

The software I write *on Github* is in the **Public Domain**, and yes, I don't even own the **copyright** on it, and I'm not responsible for it.

The rest of the time, I am just an ordinary game player and paper lover.
