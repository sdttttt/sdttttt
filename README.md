Hi, I am a casual farmers, on the Internet. at the moment I've been working on the network direction and that may change.

Usually I spend more time reading than coding.
i like to keep control of the program code, so I use as little dependency as possible.
I don't like to use **frameworks**, I prefer to use **libraries**. Don't let frameworks limit your imagination.

The rest of the time, I am just an ordinary game player and paper lover.

The software I write *on Github* is in the **Public Domain**, and yes, I don't even own the **copyright** on it, and I'm not responsible for it.
