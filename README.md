Hi, I am a lazy casual farmers, on the Internet. 
I like computer engineering, but I don't like writing code.（x _x）

The software I write *on Github* is in the **Public Domain**, and yes, I don't even own the **copyright** on it, and I'm not responsible for it. **At the same time, I do not accept any sponsorship.**

If you like my work very much, you can send me a positive email. Thank you. (" A")

The rest of the time, I am just an ordinary game player and paper lover.
