Hi, I am a bricklayer, on the Internet. I often deal with network programming. At the same time, 
I also like refactoring and design. Coding is an art. I like to build software with the simplest design.

Recently, I have been studying the encryption algorithm.

## My Friend

如果你对`计算机病毒`, `Windows内核编程`感兴趣, 请看看[@idiotc4t](https://github.com/idiotc4t)还有他的[博客](https://idiotc4t.gitbook.io/), 他是计算机以及Windows系统安全的研究者.

## Have you done anything notable? 

em... Maybe you have used `BangumiOpen`, which is an vscode extension.
I may make more contributions to some open source network projects in the future. 
My ultimate goal as a back-end programmer is to write a `DFS`.
