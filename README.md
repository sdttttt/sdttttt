## Interesting facts

* I have been using **@sdttttt** as my nick name since 2008.
The name was generated by my face roll keyboard at that time.

* I work on the back end, but I tend to work on the front end in my spare time.

* I pursue geeks in heart, but behavior is not :(

* The skills I learned were rubbish that I didn't use at work. 

* code like shit, but CICD is good. --- @idiotc4t
