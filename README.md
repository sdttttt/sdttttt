## About ME

Hi, I am a casual farmers, on the Internet. at the moment I've been working on the network direction and that may change.

Usually I spend more time reading than coding.
i like to keep control of the program code, so I use as little dependency as possible.

The rest of the time, I am just an ordinary game player and paper lover.

All the software I wrote is `Unlicense` license. the license detail can be found [here](https://unlicense.org/). They are not copyrighted, you can take, modify, sell. i don't mind writing your name on them at all. *(I want my code to live, though in a different way.)*
