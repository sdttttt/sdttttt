Hi, I am a bricklayer, on the Internet. I often deal with distributed network programming. At the same time, 
I also like refactoring and design. Coding is an art. I like to build software with the simplest design.

Recently, I have been studying the encryption algorithm.

## Have you done anything notable? 

em... Maybe you have used `BangumiOpen`, which is an vscode extension.
I may make more contributions to some open source network projects in the future. 
Please look forward.
