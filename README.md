## About me

Hi, I am a bricklayer, on the Internet. I often deal with network programming. 
I usually spend part of my time reading the literature and have very little time to code.
I like the art of design program. I was intoxicated by the excellent structural design.

## My Friend

如果你对`计算机病毒`, `Windows内核编程`感兴趣, 请看看[@idiotc4t](https://github.com/idiotc4t)还有他的[博客](https://idiotc4t.gitbook.io/), 他是研究计算机、Windows系统安全的学者.

## Have you done anything notable? 

em... Maybe you have used `BangumiOpen`, which is an vscode extension.
I may make more contributions to some open source network projects in the future. 

## Talk me 

If you are interested in my skills or need to work for free, you can talk to me about it.
