## Who am i? 

Hi, I am a bricklayer, on the Internet. I often deal with distributed network programming, but that doesn't mean I'm not good at other areas.
**Go**, **Typescript**, **Rust** is my favorite.

## Have you done anything notable?

em... Maybe you have used `BangumiOpen`, which is an vscode extension.
I may make more contributions to some open source network projects in the future. 

## Talk me

If you are interested in my skills or need to work for free, you can talk to me about it.
