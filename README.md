## Interesting facts

* I have been using **@sdttttt** as my nick name since 2008.
The name was generated by my face roll keyboard at that time.

* My original goal was to be a game developer, but I became a web developer by mistake.

* I work on the back end, but I tend to work on the front end in my spare time.

* The skills I learned were rubbish that I didn't use at work. 

* I'm more sensitive to the size of an application than its performance.

* code like shit, but CICD is good. --- @idiotc4t
