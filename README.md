## About ME

Hi, I am a casual farmers, on the Internet.

Usually I spend more time reading than coding.
i like to keep control of the program code, so I use as little dependency as possible.
*(unless there is a something that interests me)*

The rest of the time, I am just an ordinary game player and paper lover.
